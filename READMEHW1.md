# HWAssignment1

The following assignment was to clean up this code and comment
on the changes. 

One thing i noticed was that alot of the divs were unnamed and did 
not follow html semantic structure. I then replaced the divs with 
tags such as <main> <aside> <section> <nav> and <footer>. This makes 
reading the html much easier and helps to stay organized 

I then grouped together the section classes by giving them the same 
names. I did this with the classes <aside-content> and <main-content>. 
By doing this i was able to shoten up the CSS and group the styling 
together

I added the <title> to horiseon as well as alt attributes to the images.

The following assignment was to clean up this code and comment
on the changes. 

One thing i noticed was there were alot of divs in place for basic html 
tags. I then replaced the divs with tags such as <main> <aside> <section>
<nav> and <footer> to follow semantic html structure. This makes reading 
the html much easier and helps to keep the code clean and organized.

I then grouped together the section classes by giving them the same 
names. I did this with the classes <aside-content> and <main-content>. 
By doing this i was able to shorten up the CSS and group the styling 
of different portions of text and images together.

I added the <title> to horiseon as well as alt attributes to the images.
The alt attributes work as placeholders incase the images are not working;
they are used to describe the image on the page. 

This Webpage is now fully responsive when the page shrinks and no text 
overlaps due to the addition of the media query.
